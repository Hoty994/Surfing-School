                    Was founded in 2006, being the FIRST SURF SCHOOL OF VILAMOURA BEACH,
                     ALGARVE. Our school is certified by the Portuguese 
                     Surfing Federation and by Turismo de Portugal. The School aims 
                     to teach the art of surfing the waves in a safe, correct and 
                     relaxed way, always under the close and attentive supervision of teachers.
                     Thousands of people have already learned from us to slide on the wave wall
                     on top of a board.
